00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome to the course.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,290
Deployment of machine learning mothers.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,490
My name is Soledad legally and I am an experienced data scientist.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,520
I have pit mothers to assess credit risk and to prevent fraud and also to handle multiple aspects of

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,250
insurance claims.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,930
I like sharing machine learning knowledge through talks blogs and articles and I'm also an instructor

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,680
in you that me and I'm Chris Samuels.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,790
I'm an experienced machine learning software engineer and I've built code to deploy multiple machine

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,420
learning models to serve hundreds of thousands of customers.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,090
Chris and I have worked together on multiple occasions to build and deploy models for credit risk and

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,860
fraud prevention.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,290
And now we have teamed up to bring you a course that will allow you to deploy your own machine learning

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,840
models in this course you will learn how to take your machine learning models from the research stage

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,140
to a fully integrated API that can be caught live and utilized on life data to make predictions.

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,780
No machine learning model brings true value until it is fully integrated and can be used to score real

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,650
data.

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,200
So model deployment is the most important and yet most difficult part of any typical machine learning

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,550
pipeline.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,860
By the end of this course you will know all the necessary steps and things you need to consider to deploy

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,840
a machine learning model.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,950
What is more the deployment model deployment is the process of integrating a machine learning model

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,450
into an existing production environment so that we can use it to make business decisions based alive

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,780
or future data.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,130
It is one of the latest stages in the machine learning pipeline and potentially the most challenging.

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,110
Why is more than deployment so important.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,900
For a business to be able to leverage the power of a machine learning model the model needs to be fully

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,270
deployed into production.

28
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:58,990
If we cannot get practical insight from the model that is if we cannot score like data or real data

29
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,980
with it then the impact of the model is severely limited.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,470
Model deployment is one of the most difficult processes in the machine learning pipeline and also the

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,860
one that will allow us to extract real value from our mother mother deployment requires coordination

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,940
between data scientists I.T. teams and their ops software developers and business professionals to make

33
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,160
sure the model works reliably in their organization's production environment this represents a major

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,170
challenge because there is often a discrepancy between the programming language in which the machine

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:40,050
learning model is written and the languages your production system can understand and record in the

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:47,660
model can extend the project timeline by weeks or months in order to get the most value out of the machine

37
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,790
learning mothers.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,160
It is important to deploy them into production as seamlessly as possible so the business can start using

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,920
them to make practical decisions.

40
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,190
So why should you take this course in this course.

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,710
We are going to take you through the entire machine learning lifecycle.

42
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,590
We will start with building a machine learning model utilizing Jupiter and notebooks which is what most

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,240
data scientists are used to.

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,290
Then you will learn how to transform that code into code that can be used in production.

45
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,170
So first we will show you the best practices around writing production code and then you will learn

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,830
how to create an API and make calls to the API.

47
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,900
Then we'll introduce you to testing to corroborate that research and production models produced the

48
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,700
same outcome given the same data you learn about continuous integration.

49
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,850
And finally we will cover various deployment solutions available to you such as platform as a service

50
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,250
or infrastructure as a service.

51
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,710
You will also learn about how to use Docker to ensure model reproducibility and robustness.

52
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:55,070
Who is this course for deployment of machine learning mothers requires a concerted effort among data

53
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,930
scientists software developers data engineers and business domain experts.

54
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:07,910
This course offers something new and useful for all of these professionals the cause is ideally suited

55
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,300
for intermediate and advanced data scientists.

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,100
If you have already built a few Machine Learning mothers and are familiar with the different steps required

57
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,800
to read the modern like feature engineering feature selection and would like guidance deploying mothers

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,490
to production then this is the course for you.

59
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,550
The course is also suitable for data engineers wanting to integrate mother production and AP ice into

60
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,570
their existing data pipelines this course is also suitable for software developers that want to expand

61
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:45,740
their skills to step into a development and finally as we use mostly open source tools.

62
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
This course is also suitable for open source lovers.

63
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,610
So what will you take home from this course.

64
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,190
In this course you will get more than eight hours of video content and lifetime access to the lectures

65
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,780
you will take.

66
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,880
Ready to use code and deploy your machine learning models using this code the code will be suitable

67
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,000
to create and expand your models in production with tests and error handling.

68
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,020
Also you'll be provided with code to build the API eyes and make calls to them with life data.

69
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,340
You will learn how to containerized your applications using Docker and we will guide you through deploying

70
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,830
your machine learning systems onto both platform as a service and infrastructure as a service.

71
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,450
Cloud computing solutions.

72
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,910
Finally we also include links and references to what other companies are doing worldwide to smooth and
