00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,650
Welcome to the lecture on knowledge requirements.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,790
In this video you can learn the knowledge you should have to make the most out of this course the courses

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,960
tailored to students with some knowledge of data science.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,180
You should be familiar with the meaning of feature engineering and feature selection and why it is important

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,040
and you should also know at least the most commonly used machine learning algorithms like linear and

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,010
logistic regression and Random Forests.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,580
You should also know how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm in the course we

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:42,580
will deploy a linear regression model and in the last section we will deploy a convolution of neural

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,020
network.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,090
It will be helpful for you to understand what a linear regression is although you don't necessarily

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:55,580
need to be familiar with deep learning to follow on with Section 13 in Section 2.

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:02,740
We give you a quite extensive overview on the different steps of the machine learning pipeline including

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,570
what feature engineering is and what feature selection is and why they are important.

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,240
However it is not within the scope of the course to teach you the different ways in which you can engineer

15
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,490
and select your features.

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,370
It is also not within the scope of the course to teach what the different algorithms are and what deep

17
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,630
learning is.

18
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:29,050
So here we will focus mostly on the deployment aspect of things only covering things about machine learning

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,210
when they are important for more deployment.

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,600
If you feel you need to learn more about any of the things in this slide we have included plenty of

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,450
additional resources that you can use to level up your skills.

22
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,040
And of course you can always ask questions in the forums.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,500
You should also have a good Python programming skills in particularly around libraries for numerical

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,090
computing and machine learning.

25
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,300
We will capitalize on the use of the could learn pipeline so the more familiar you are with site could

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,880
learn the most you will get out of the course if you're not extremely familiar though.

27
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,370
Don't worry we have included plenty of resources to brush up your skills.

28
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,040
This might mean that you will need extra time to fully understand the code we present in this course.

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,950
But by no means it means that you won't be able to get to the result desired which is deploying your

30
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,020
mothers in this course.

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
We're going to use a python three point six installation if you don't have one.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,740
You can get it following the link in this slide.

33
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,730
Any other Python three point six installation will also do the trick and we're going to tell more about

34
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,040
packaged versions and environments in dedicated lectures throughout the course.

35
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,490
We will be using datasets publicly available in Kaggle so you will need to set up a Kaggle account which

36
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,490
is totally free and will allow you to access to all the data sets and competitions available in Kaggle

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,690
to try your newly acquired skills.

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,690
Finally it is important for water deployment to work in dedicated environments and use it to track code

39
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,040
version.

40
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,960
Therefore knowledge of these skills will be highly beneficial for you.

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,870
We do however include a section to refresh on the use of environments and the use of it which can help

42
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,790
you get started and follow through the course.

43
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,930
In that section we will also include plenty of resources where you can learn more about environments

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,690
and the use of IT in general.

45
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,680
So let's go ahead and get started.
