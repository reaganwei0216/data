    "### What is  Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the first steps with Neo4j?\n",
    "\n",
    "These introductory tutorials and developer guides will guide you through much of your initial learning for Neo4j and give you resources to continue your education.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/getting_stated.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Connected information is everywhere in the world around us. Neo4j was built to efficiently store, handle, and query highly-connected data in your data model. With a powerful and flexible data model, you can represent your real-world, variably-structured information without a loss of richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neo4j Graph Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "At Neo4j, we want to provide options to solve many different kinds of business and technical needs. Our goal is that our products are simple and fit your use case, whatever it may be. Whether you are relying upon graphs for transactions, market analysis, operations optimizations, or anything else, Neo4j strives to provide a seamless process for integrating our tools with the rest of your existing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capabilities in the Neo4j graph platform include aiding developers to import data to the graph, business analysts to explore the data with ease, and data scientists to make decisions based on analysis results. No matter your role within your organization, we want to put the power of the graph and Neo4j within reach to help you maximize business value and achieve technical needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The richness of graph data and the performance of your queries depends closely on how the data is modeled. Data in Neo4j should resemble the real-world information and relationships, but data modeling focuses on understanding what questions the data will answer and what types of information you need from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data model may also impact the queries you write and the performance of the results returned. Choosing to store certain pieces of data as properties versus separate nodes and determining how to structure your relationships is part of the process to maintain good data and maximize query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cypher - A Next-Generation Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to make querying graph data not only fun, but easy to learn, understand, and use for everyone. That’s why we created a human-friendly, declarative query language which uses ASCII-Art to represent visual graph patterns for finding or updating data in Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cypher was based on the power of SQL, but optimized specifically for graphs. The syntax is concise and straightforward, allowing users to easily write all the normal CRUD operations in a simple and maintainable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations often provide a better understanding of your data than textual formats can support. As one of our customers said of graph visualization, \"I can look at a graph of transactions and fraudulent activity pops out for me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j offers methods for visualizing data, such as Neo4j Browser for developers, Neo4j Bloom for analysts and others looking for natural language search, and libraries for developers to embed graphs directly into their applications. We also have several partners providing additional options in this space to fit a variety of visualization needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Import\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking to bring data into Neo4j from another source, Neo4j has a variety of tools and partner applications for different approaches to the data import problem. We want to maximize value by simplifying the import process and allow you to start analyzing your graph data sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this area to help developers transfer some of their own relevant data into Neo4j to see how it would look and what a graph database can help them do with it. We also have options for other types of data import, including integrations with other vendor products and tools. This area aids businesses to transport data from technology to technology as easily and smoothly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drivers for Popular Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing applications using Neo4j is straightforward. Using the binary \"Bolt\" protocol, we provide officially-supported drivers for languages such as .Net, Java (also Spring), JavaScript, and Python. Other drivers for the binary and the http protocol are developed by our active contributor community.\n",
    "\n",
    "These drivers allow developers to build applications and integrations using the programming language(s) of their choice and easily interact with data in the Neo4j database.v\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploying Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking to run Neo4j in production environments, we provide various options for types of deployments and configurations. Neo4j provides options for causal clustering, performance tuning, cloud deployment, backups and failovers, and more. We also have tools to plan and manage your deployments and preferences, including a calculator to help you know how much hardware you will need to run your data in Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "From local to cloud deployments and anything in between, we can help satisfy your preferences and requirements. While each implementation will have its own advantages and difficulties, the power to choose resides in the business and technical needs of your company."

    "#### Graph DB 的三種模型\n",
    "\n",
    "為了避免各位直接把 GraphDB 和 Neo4j 劃上等號，在此先從 Graph DB 開始介紹，目前 Graph DB 有三大模型如下：\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Property Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j 就是這一類，藉由許多的 nodes、relations、properties 所組合而成\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hypergraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "和前者的差別在於，一個 relation 可以連接多個 nodes，很適合用於資料彼此有大量的「多對多」關係的情境\n",

    "- What is a graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "圖是物件的集合，每個物件與其他物件都有關聯。\n",
    "\n",
    "圖學是用於數學分析目的的數據建模的一種有用方法，並且已經存在了很長時間。第一次使用圖學是 Leonhard Euler 在1735年提出的；他用圖論來證明著名的 Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem (一筆畫與柯尼斯堡七橋問題)。\n",
    "\n",
    "您小時候有沒有玩過益智遊戲中的「一筆畫」呢？就是一個圖型內有數個節點，然後有數條線將它串連起來。遊戲的方法很簡單，就是可以從任何一個點開始走起，必須把每個點都走過一遍，而每個點都不能重複走過，這就是一筆畫的玩法。事實上，這個俗稱一筆畫的遊戲，其實就是來自拓撲學中的「七橋問題」。\n",
    "在拓撲學的歷史上，第一個的難題源自於東普魯士，普列戈利亞河畔的柯尼斯堡（今日俄羅斯的加里寧格勒）。當時的市區跨越普列戈利亞河兩岸，河的中心有兩座小島，小島與兩岸之間有七座橋相連。\n",
    "由於當地的居民在散步時，常常會經過許多橋，因此便引發了一些人的好奇心，他們想了解是否有可能在每座橋只走一次的前提下，將所有橋都走遍，這就是著名的柯尼斯堡「七橋問題」。\n",
    "這個問題，後來被瑞士數學家李昂哈德·尤拉（Leonhard Euler，1707~1783）於1735年所解決。\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/SevenBridges.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "尤拉發現，島與橋的實際位置及距離，並不是解決問題的重點。重要的是這些橋的連結方式。因此，七橋問題可以從實體的地圖，畫成如網路圖（上下兩個點是兩岸，中間左右兩個點是兩座島，七條線是七座橋）。\n",
    "\n",
    "尤拉指出，網路圖中的節點，如果有奇數條線向外延伸出去，可以稱為「奇數點」；如果有偶數條線，就稱為「偶數點」。而如果這個圖形必須符合兩個條件，這個問題才有解。\n",
    "\n",
    "首先，圖形的每個點都必須是偶數點；其次，如果圖形中有奇數點，奇數點最多也只能有兩個，因為，為了要一次走完，一定要在奇數點開始或結束，所以最多只能有兩個奇數點。至於奇數點的線條數則不一定要一樣，一個三的奇數點，可以搭配五的奇數點。\n",
    "\n",
    "由於柯尼斯堡七橋問題的網路中，因為所有四個陸地都被奇數數量的橋樑所接觸，即有四個奇數點，所以這個問題「無解」。如果您有興趣，不妨拿出來筆來自己畫一畫，甚至可以出題目自己來試試。"

    "\n",
    "我們將從兩個節點(Node)開始，這兩個節點相互關聯，用一條線將它們連接起來，這條線又稱之為關係(Relationship)，而節點(Node)和與關係(Relationship)所組成的即為圖的基礎了。\n",

    "在Neo4j中，每個節點都有不同的顏色，也許是為了區分其類型(類別)與另一個節點。例如，藍色節點表示一個人，而該人節點的名稱為 Jane。綠色節點表示車輛，該車輛節點具有汽車類型。\n",

    "在Neo4j中，關係數據的目的是減少 “收集和檢查” 的需要 (gather and inspect)，通常可以依據關係查詢出所有具有相同關係的節點，然後掃描目標節點數據以確定哪些是具有意義，進而過濾沒有意義的節點，直到疊代查詢不到更多延伸的節點為止。相反，我們可以使用關係中附帶的資訊，也可以用來過濾沒有意義的關係。"

    "\n",
    "Unlike other databases, relationships take first priority in graph databases. This means your application doesn’t have to infer data connections using foreign keys or out-of-band processing, such as MapReduce. By assembling the simple abstractions of nodes and relationships into connected structures, graph databases enable us to build sophisticated models that map closely to our problem domain. Data scientists can use the relationships in a data model to help enterprises make important business decisions."

A relationship represents the verb or action between two entities. The MARRIED relationship is defined from one Person node to another Person node. Although the relationship is created as directional, it can be queried in a non-directional manner. That is, you can query if two Person nodes have a MARRIED relationship, regardless of the direction of the relationship. For some data models, the direction of the relationship is significant. For example, in Facebook, using the IS_FRIEND relationship is used to indicate which Person invited the other Person to be a friend.\n",
