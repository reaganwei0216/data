    "## Introduction to Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive Neo4j graph tutorial covers bank fraud detection scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks and Insurance companies lose billions of dollars every year to fraud. Traditional methods of fraud detection play an important role in minimizing these losses. However, increasingly sophisticated fraudsters have developed a variety of ways to elude discovery, both by working together and by leveraging various other means of constructing false identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Scenario\n",
    "While no fraud prevention measures can ever be perfect, significant opportunity for improvement lies in looking beyond the individual data points, to the connections that link them. Oftentimes these connections go unnoticed until it is too late-- something that is unfortunate, as these connections oftentimes hold the best clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Typical Scenario\n",
    "While the exact details behind each first-party fraud collusion vary from operation to operation, the pattern below illustrates how fraud rings commonly operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A group of two or more people organize into a fraud ring\n",
    "- The ring shares a subset of legitimate contact information, i.e., phone numbers and addresses, combining them to create a number of fictional identities\n",
    "- Ring members open accounts using these fictional identities\n",
    "- New accounts are added to the original ones: unsecured credit lines, credit cards, overdraft protection, personal loans, etc.\n",
    "- The accounts are used as normally, with regular purchases and timely payments\n",
    "- Banks increase the revolving credit lines over time, due to the observed responsible credit behavior\n",
    "- One day the ring \"busts out\", coordinating their activity, maxing out all of their credit lines, and disappearing\n",
    "- Sometimes fraudsters will go a step further and bring all of their balances to zero using fake checks immediately before the prior step, doubling the damage\n",
    "- Collections processes ensue, but agents are never able to reach the fraudster\n",
    "- The uncollectible debt is written off\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Solution\n",
    "Graph databases offer new methods of uncovering fraud rings and other sophisticated scams with a high degree of accuracy, and are capable of stopping advanced fraud scenarios in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Graph Databases Can Help\n",
    "Augmenting one’s existing fraud detection infrastructure to support ring detection can be done by running appropriate entity link analysis queries using a graph database, and running checks during key stages in the customer & account lifecycle, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the time the account is created\n",
    "- During an investigation\n",
    "- As soon as a credit balance threshold is hit\n",
    "- When a check is bounced\n",
    "\n",
    "Real time graph traversals tied to the right kinds of events can help banks identify probable fraud rings, during or even before the Bust-Out occurs."

    "Graph databases have emerged as an ideal tool for overcoming these hurdles. Languages like Cypher provide a simple semantic for detecting rings in the graph, navigating connections in memory, in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph data model below represents how the data actually looks to the graph database, and illustrates how one can find rings by simply walking the graph:\n",
